        <p>Tips for ensuring good generation:
        <ul>
            <li>Include the term "very clear audio" to generate the highest quality audio, and "very noisy audio" for high levels of background noise</li>
            <li>Punctuation can be used to control the prosody of the generations, e.g. use commas to add small breaks in speech</li>
            <li>The remaining speech features (gender, speaking rate, pitch and reverberation) can be controlled directly through the prompt</li>
